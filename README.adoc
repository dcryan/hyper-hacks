Here are my macOS Sierra hacks using some combination of Keyboard Maestro, Karabiner-Elements, and Hammerspoon

== Background:

When macOS Sierra hit, everyone using a http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/[Hyper key hack] based off of Karabiner and Seil felt a deep loss.

This hack with link:https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements[Karabiner-Elements] and link:http://www.hammerspoon.org[Hammerspoon] brings back that old-time hyper key feel, complete with ESCAPE binding.

== Installation:

* Install Hammerspoon
* Install Karabiner-Elements
* Put `hammerspoon/init.lua` in `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`
* Put `karabiner.d/configuration/karabiner.json` in `~/.karabiner.d/configuration/karabiner.json`

That's pretty much it.

This is my first attempt and has a few examples in the `init.lua`. I aim to learn some more Lua and clean up the repetitious code.

In the meantime, check out the link:https://github.com/lodestone/hyper-hacks/wiki[Wiki] for ideas on how to configure your `init.lua`.
